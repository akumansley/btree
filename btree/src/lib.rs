//! A concurrent B-tree implementation
//!
//! This implementation relies on a QSBR (quiescent-state based reclamation) system to free removed nodes and entries.
//! Your code MUST call `qsbr_reclaimer().register_thread()` before interacting with the btree, and
//! MUST periodically call and `qsbr_reclaimer().mark_quiescent()` while holding no possibly-deleted
//! references or it will leak memory. Calling `mark_quiescent` while holding possibly-deleted references will cause UB.
//!
//! The tree also allows for long-lived concurrent access to keys and values, so those may not be mutated in place except with additional synchronization,
//! and must be dropped via the tree's methods or manually via QSBR.
//!
//! The tree is intended to be used with variable sized keys -- nodes only store pointers to keys and values. Keys are reference counted when
//! they're used for split keys, not cloned. The tree uses "hybrid locks" for scalability when the tree is large, and the tree provides
//! several parallel bulk operations that should be very fast with large amounts of data.
